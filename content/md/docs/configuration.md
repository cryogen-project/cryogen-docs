| `post-per-page`                     | If post previews are enabled then this is the maximum number of previews on a page.

| * `clean-urls`                      | `:trailing-slash`, `:no-trailing-slash`, and `:dirty` are valid options. Set this to `:trailing-slash` to emit html as subdirectories, e.g., `prefix/root/page-name/index.html`. Links would then end in `/page-name/`. Set this to `:no-trailing-slash` if you use GitHub Pages and prefer URLs not contain a final trailing slash. Links would then end in `/page-name`. <strong>Note:</strong> `:no-trailing-slash` will not work on all hosting providers such as Amazon S3. Set this to `:dirty` will result in `prefix/root/page-name.html`. Links would then end in `/page-name.html` **Note 2:** You can override the default URL with a smart use of <a href="/docs/customizing-cryogen.html"><code>:update-article-fn</code></a>. |
| `collapse-subdirs?`                 | Set this to `true` if you have your posts or pages organized in subdirectories and do not want that structure reflected in the url.  e.g., `/awesome-post/` instead of `/2016/awesome-post/`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `hide-future-posts?`                | Set this to `true` to include only current and past blogs in the compiled site. This allows for easy drafting of future articles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `klipse`                            | Set [Klipse](https://github.com/viebel/klipse) configuration for the whole site. See [Klipse Integration](klipse.html) for details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `debug?`                            | Enable debug outputs for compiler.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
{.table .table-bordered}

### Custom Values
In addition to these default configuration options, you may add your own custom values. For example, if your blog has a subtitle that you'd like to display on your site:

1. Add `:subtitle "My subtitle"` to the config file
2. Inject the value into your templates via Selmer using `{% subtitle %}`

## Advanced Configuration
 If you want to override or extend `config.edn` from code, (e.g. by reading environment variables or by using an untracked file) you can edit `src/cryogen/core.clj` and `src/cryogen/server.clj` to pass a clojure map to the `compile-assets-timed` function. This is especially useful if you are making use of the custom values to configure 3rd party integrations like ReCaptcha.

 For Example, if you wanted to have private options loaded from a `secrets.edn` file, you could do the following:
 ```clojure
 ;; src/cryogen/core.clj

 ;; ...
 (defn -main []
   (load-plugins)
   (compile-assets-timed (read-string (slurp "secrets.edn")))
   (System/exit 0))
 ;; ...
 ```


```clojure
 ;; src/cryogen/server.clj

 ;; ...
 (defn init []
   (let [overrides (read-string (slurp "secrets.edn"))]
     (load-plugins)
     (compile-assets-timed overrides)
     (let [ignored-files (-> (resolve-config) :ignored-files)]
       (start-watcher! "content" ignored-files (partial compile-assets-timed overrides))
       (start-watcher! "themes" ignored-files (partial compile-assets-timed overrides)))))
;; ...
```
### Deriving Additional Params for Use in Templates

If you wish to further derive more parameters from the data that the cryogen compiler generates, you may pass in a `:extend-params-fn` in your overrides map which will be invoked by the compiler like so

```clojure
((:extend-params-fn overrides)
  params
  {:posts posts
   :pages pages
   :posts-by-tag posts-by-tag
   :navbar-pages navbar-pages
   :sidebar-pages sidebar-pages})
```

It should return the `params`, likely with additional keys. These will be visible to your templates.

See [Customizing/Extending Cryogen](/docs/customizing-cryogen.html) for an example.
